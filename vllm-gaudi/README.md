*Latest News* 🔥
- [2026/08] Version 0.26.0 is now available, built on [vLLM 0.26.0](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/releases/tag/v0.26.0) and fully compatible with [Intel® Gaudi® v1.24.1](https://docs.habana.ai/en/v1.24.1/Release_Notes/GAUDI_Release_Notes.html) with PyTorch 2.11.

  This release enables the plugin on upstream vLLM 0.26.0 and realigns the Intel® Gaudi® platform with extensive upstream API drift across MoE/MLA, quantization, serving, attention, and the NIXL connector. It adds new model support for MiniMax-M3, the Gemma-4 family, the Kimi-K2.5 vision tower, and Qwen3-Coder-Next, improves MXFP4 gpt-oss serving and FP8/INC quantization stability, reduces graph compilation and warmup overhead, and strengthens security.

- [2026/07] Version 0.24.0 is now available, built on [vLLM 0.24.0](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/releases/tag/v0.24.0) and fully compatible with [Intel® Gaudi® v1.24.1](https://docs.habana.ai/en/v1.24.1/Release_Notes/GAUDI_Release_Notes.html) with PyTorch 2.11.

  This release enables the plugin on upstream vLLM 0.24.0 and adapts the Intel® Gaudi® platform to upstream changes, including the FusedMoE/MoERunner inversion, KV-connector and offloading refactors, and the Mamba/GDN rewrite. It also adds Qwen3-Next architecture support, improves FP8/INC quantization memory usage and stability, switches hybrid models to a TPC-native `causal_conv1d` update path, extends single-card model swapping to hybrid models, and strengthens security.

- [2026/04] Version 0.19.0 is now available, built on [vLLM 0.19.0](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/releases/tag/v0.19.0) and fully compatible with [Intel® Gaudi® v1.24.0](https://docs.habana.ai/en/v1.24.0/Release_Notes/GAUDI_Release_Notes.html) with PyTorch 2.10.

  This release upgrades the platform to Intel® Gaudi® Software v1.24.0 with PyTorch 2.10. It introduces Qwen 3.5 model support, Mamba prefix caching for hybrid models, MxFP4 weight dequantization, LMCache integration, and a custom depthwise conv1d TPC kernel for MambaMixer2. Performance improvements include torch.compile-compatible online defragmentation, improved warmup time, and optimized hybrid KV cache visibility.

- [2026/04] Version 0.17.1 is now available, built on [vLLM 0.17.1](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/releases/tag/v0.17.1) and fully compatible with [Intel® Gaudi® v1.23.0](https://docs.habana.ai/en/v1.23.0/Release_Notes/GAUDI_Release_Notes.html).

  This patch release backports critical fixes and improvements including MxFP4 weight loading, Granite 4.0-h calibration, prefix caching for HPUMambaMixer2, OOM crash fixes, and SDL secure error handling improvements.

## About

The vLLM Hardware Plugin for Intel® Gaudi® integrates [Intel® Gaudi® AI accelerators](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/index.html) with [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/) to optimize large language model inference. It follows the [[RFC]: Hardware pluggable](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/11162) and [[RFC]: Enhancing vLLM Plugin Architecture](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/19161) principles, providing a modular interface for Intel® Gaudi® hardware. For more information, see the [Plugin System](https://vllm-gaudi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev_guide/plugin_system.html) document.

## Getting Started

1. [Set up](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/Installation_Guide/index.html) your execution environment. Additionally, to achieve the best performance on HPU, follow the methods outlined in the [Optimizing Training Platform Guide](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/PyTorch/Model_Optimization_PyTorch/Optimization_in_Training_Platform.html).

2. Get the last verified vLLM commit. While vLLM Hardware Plugin for Intel® Gaudi® follows the latest vLLM commits, upstream API updates may introduce compatibility issues. The saved commit has been thoroughly validated.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-gaudi
    cd vllm-gaudi
    export VLLM_COMMIT_HASH=$(git show "origin/vllm/last-good-commit-for-vllm-gaudi:VLLM_STABLE_COMMIT" 2>/dev/null)
    cd ..
    ```

3. Install vLLM using `pip` or [build it from source](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/getting_started/installation/gpu/index.html#build-wheel-from-source):

    ```bash
    # Build vLLM from source for empty platform, reusing existing torch installation
    git clone https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm
    cd vllm
    git checkout $VLLM_COMMIT_HASH
    pip install -r <(sed '/^torch/d' requirements/build/cuda.txt)
    VLLM_TARGET_DEVICE=empty pip install --no-build-isolation -e .
    cd ..
    ```

4. Install vLLM Hardware Plugin for Intel® Gaudi® from source:

    ```bash
    cd vllm-gaudi
    pip install -e .
    cd ..
    ```

5. Install torchaudio (required by some upstream vLLM models such as QWEN3_5). Use the CPU wheel with `--no-deps` to avoid pulling a conflicting CUDA torch:

    ```bash
    TORCH_VERSION=$(python3 -c "import re, torch; print(re.match(r'(\d+\.\d+\.\d+)', torch.__version__).group(1))")
    pip install --no-deps torchaudio==$TORCH_VERSION --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
    ```

    To see all the available installation methods, such as NIXL, see the [Installation](https://vllm-gaudi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html) guide.

## Distributed Executor Backend and Worker Start Method

On HPU, multi-card serving uses vLLM's `mp`, the Python multiprocessing distributed executor backend, by default whenever `world_size > 1`, that is, `TP * PP * DP > 1`. When `world_size == 1`, vLLM uses the in-process `uni` backend.

The worker start method is controlled by `VLLM_WORKER_MULTIPROC_METHOD`, with `fork` or `spawn` as the available options. Upstream vLLM defaults to `fork`; however, on HPU, the platform layer automatically overrides it to `spawn` because forking after HPU driver initialization leaves driver state in child processes and can cause hangs on exit. A warning is logged when the override is applied. To opt out, set `VLLM_WORKER_MULTIPROC_METHOD=fork` explicitly, although this is not recommended. The `uni`, `external_launcher`, and `ray` backends do not start workers via Python `multiprocessing`, so the value has no practical effect for them.

For more information, see [docs/configuration/env_variables.md](docs/configuration/env_variables.md#distributed-executor-backend-on-hpu).
