# Pipeline Parallelism

!!! note
    Full support for pipeline parallelism will be included in the upcoming release.

Pipeline parallelism is a distributed model parallelization technique that splits the model vertically across its layers, distributing different parts of the model across multiple devices. This approach is particularly useful when a model cannot fit on a single node using tensor parallelism alone and requires a multi-node setup. In such cases, the model’s layers can be split across multiple nodes, allowing each node to handle a segment of the model. For example, if you have two nodes, each equipped with 8 HPUs, you no longer need to set `tensor_parallel_size=16`. Instead, you can configure `tensor_parallel_size=8` and `pipeline_parallel_size=2`.

The following example shows how to use the pipeline parallelism with vLLM on HPU:

```bash
vllm serve <model_path> --device hpu --tensor-parallel-size 8 --pipeline-parallel-size 2
```

Since pipeline parallelism runs a `pp_size` number of virtual engines on each device, you have to lower `max_num_seqs` accordingly, as it acts as a micro batch for each virtual engine.

Currently, pipeline parallelism on the lazy mode requires the `PT_HPUGRAPH_DISABLE_TENSOR_CACHE=0` flag.
