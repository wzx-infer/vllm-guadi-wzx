"""Runtime monkey-patches applied when the HPU plugin is loaded.

Currently:

* ``torch.accelerator.empty_cache`` — HPU's allocator does not implement the
  ``c10::DeviceAllocator`` interface, so the upstream helper raises
  ``RuntimeError: Allocator for hpu is not a DeviceAllocator``.  We replace
  it with an HPU-safe variant that routes through
  ``current_platform.empty_cache()`` (a no-op on HPU).  This also makes the
  ``cleanup_dist_env_and_memory`` patch resilient to import-order issues.

* ``torch._C._host_emptyCache`` — does not exist on HPU; we install a no-op
  stub to prevent ``AttributeError`` in ``cleanup_dist_env_and_memory``.

* ``torch.accelerator.empty_host_cache`` — vllm PR #51107 switched
  ``cleanup_dist_env_and_memory`` from ``torch._C._host_emptyCache()`` to
  ``torch.accelerator.empty_host_cache()``.  On torch>=2.9 the attribute exists,
  so vllm's ``except AttributeError`` guard no longer catches it; the call
  dispatches to ``at::accelerator::emptyHostCache()``, which has no HPU host-cache
  hook and segfaults at teardown.  We replace it with a no-op (sibling of the
  ``empty_cache`` patch above).

* ``vllm.distributed.parallel_state.cleanup_dist_env_and_memory`` — upstream
  (since vllm PR #34328) calls ``torch.accelerator.empty_cache()``, which
  requires the device's allocator to be a ``c10::DeviceAllocator``.  We
  replace it with an HPU-safe variant that uses
  ``current_platform.empty_cache()`` instead (see GAUDISW-247825).

* ``vllm.v1.sample.ops.logprobs.batched_count_greater_than`` — upstream
  decorates this function with ``@torch.compile(dynamic=True, ...)``.
  Habana's ``recipe_compiler`` backend cannot handle the symbolic shapes
  produced by ``dynamic=True`` (and by ``mark_unbacked`` in the caller),
  raising ``TypeError: Cannot convert symbols to int``.  We replace it
  with a plain (uncompiled) version of the same function.  The replacement
  is deferred to ``load_general_plugins`` time to avoid importing
  ``vllm.v1.sample.sampler`` during early plugin registration, which would
  trigger a heavy import chain that interferes with platform initialisation.

* ``vllm.v1.sample.sampler.Sampler.gather_logprobs`` — upstream PR #38933
  added two ``mark_unbacked()`` calls inside ``gather_logprobs`` to prevent
  0->1 batch-size specialization recompiles for ``batched_count_greater_than``
  on CUDA.  On HPU, ``torch._dynamo`` marks ``mark_unbacked`` as a forbidden
  callable (``is_forbidden=True``), so tracing a compiled ``Sampler`` raises
  ``AssertionError: Attempt to trace forbidden callable mark_unbacked`` for
  any request with ``logprobs=true``.  We replace ``gather_logprobs`` with an
  identical implementation that omits the two ``mark_unbacked`` calls.  HPU
  handles dynamic batch shapes without this hint.

* ``vllm.distributed.device_communicators.shm_broadcast.check_shm_free_space``
  — upstream PR #48879 ("Fail fast when /dev/shm is too small for the shm ring
  buffer") added a pre-allocation guard that compares the ring buffer's *full
  nominal* size (default ``24 MiB x 10 = 240 MiB`` per ``MessageQueue``) against
  the free space on ``/dev/shm`` and raises ``RuntimeError: Insufficient space
  in /dev/shm`` when it does not fit. HPU CI containers expose the Docker
  default 64 MiB ``/dev/shm``, where the pre-#48879 code path worked fine: the
  segment is created with ``SharedMemory(create=True, size=...)`` (an
  ``ftruncate`` on tmpfs, which allocates pages lazily on write), and the TP2 /
  DP / multi-proc EngineCore workers only ever touch a small fraction of the
  nominal ring. The new eager check aborts EngineCore start-up before any page
  is touched, breaking every shared-memory-broadcast config
  (``run_data_parallel_test``, ``run_tp2_load_generate_test``,
  ``run_deepseek_v2_inc_dynamic_tp2_load_generate_test``,
  ``run_gsm8k_qwen3_30b_test``). Restore the pre-#48879 behaviour on HPU by
  replacing the guard with a no-op so the lazy tmpfs allocation proceeds.

  Upstream ref: https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/48879

* ``vllm.v1.core.block_pool.BlockPool.free_blocks`` — upstream PR #42656
  ("Apply LRU policy only to proper cache entries") made ``free_blocks``
  partition freed blocks into with-hash / without-hash lists and issue two
  queue ops (``prepend_n`` + ``append_n``) on every engine step.  When prefix
  caching is disabled every block's hash is ``None``, so the split is a no-op
  that only adds per-step CPU overhead — a measurable decode-throughput loss
  on small/low-batch models.  We restore a single-pass free for the
  ``enable_caching=False`` case and delegate to the original implementation
  when prefix caching is on.  Remove once fixed upstream.

* ``vllm.model_executor.layers.mamba.abstract.MambaBase.bind_kv_cache`` —
  upstream PR #44456 unpacks a single packed int8 page via
  ``kv_cache.squeeze(dim=(1, 2))``.  The HPU runner allocates a separate
  tensor per Mamba state and hands the layer a ready-made tuple, so the
  upstream method raises ``AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute
  'squeeze'`` at EngineCore init.  We replace it with a variant that assigns
  the pre-split tuple directly (restoring the pre-#44456 contract).  Regressed
  when the 0.26.0 sliding-window port dropped the original patch.

* ``transformers.integrations.sdpa_attention.sdpa_attention_forward`` — the
  transformers library's SDPA attention uses ``F.scaled_dot_product_attention``
  which routes to suboptimal kernels on HPU. We replace it with an HPU-optimized
  version that uses FusedSDPA when the ``fsdpa_impl`` attention implementation
  is configured, providing 1.4-2x performance improvement for models that use
  transformers SDPA attention (e.g., vision encoders in Gemma4 models).
