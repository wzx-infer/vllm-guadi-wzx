"""Unit tests for explicit multimodal warmup resolutions.

VLLM_MULTIMODAL_RESOLUTIONS lets a deployment pin the raw image resolutions
warmup should compile graphs for. The parsed WxH pairs are fed as raw images
through the model's own processor at warmup time, so the compiled vision grid
matches what real traffic at the same resolution produces (see
HPUModelRunner._build_raw_image_processor_inputs). These tests cover the env
parsing contract; grid-invariance across resolutions is exercised by the
multimodal e2e warmup tests on HPU.
