## Experimental Features

### Runtime Scale Patching

Warm-up time for FP8 models is significantly longer than for BF16 due to additional graph
compilations triggered by varying constant scale values in quantized model layers.

You can reduce the FP8 warm-up time by setting the `RUNTIME_SCALE_PATCHING=1` environment variable and
selecting a hardware-aligned per-tensor `scale_method` provided by the `INC JSON config <json-options>`.
This feature is recommended for larger models, such as 70B and 405B. When combined with
`VLLM_BUCKETING_STRATEGY=exp` for FP8 models, it can reduce warm-up time by up to 90%.

!!!note
    This feature reduces FP8 warm-up time but may lower model throughput by 5-20%. Future releases will improve performance and extend support to more options. Currently, the feature is supported with Lazy mode (`PT_HPU_LAZY_MODE=1`) and `torch.compile`. It supports Llama workloads using FP8 execution of Linear and FSDPA layers, and casting ops between BF16 and FP8. MoE and Convolution options are not yet supported.

### Trivial Scales Optimization

The `PT_HPU_H2D_TRIVIAL_SCALES_MODE` flag controls the optimization of trivial scales, such as scale values equal to 1.0, in the `RUNTIME_SCALE_PATCHING` mode. Enabling this optimization can increase warm-up and compilation time because additional graphs are generated, but it may improve runtime performance by reducing the number of multiplication operations.

The following values are supported:

- `0`: No optimization (default).
- `1`: Removes scales equal to 1.0 in `cast_to_fp8_v2` and `cast_from_fp8`, disabling the corresponding `mult_fwd` (multiplication) node.
- `2`: Applies the same optimization as mode `1`, and additionally removes reciprocal scales in `fp8_gemm_v2`.

### Dynamic Quantization for MatMul and KV‑cache Operations

This feature applies dynamic quantization to MatMul operations and KV-cache storage, improving performance with minimal expected impact on accuracy.

To enable the feature:

1. Set the environment variable:

   ```
   export VLLM_DYNAMIC_KV_QUANT=1
   ```

2. Update your quantization configuration file with the following options:

   ```
   "dynamicquantization": "True",
   "scaleformat": "CONST"
   ```

### Single-Process Model Swap

This feature enables sequential serving of multiple small models from one API server process without restart. The implementation uses a dedicated Gaudi OpenAI server entrypoint together with an in-process V1 engine reconfigure path.

To enable the feature:

1. Create a `yaml` file with models' config. For example:

    ```yaml
    default_model: llama
    models:
        llama:
            model: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
            max_model_len: 4096
            tensor_parallel_size: 1
        qwen:
            model: Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B
            max_model_len: 4096
            tensor_parallel_size: 1
    ```

2. Set the required environment variables:

    ```bash
    export VLLM_SERVER_DEV_MODE=1
    export VLLM_ALLOW_INSECURE_SERIALIZATION=1
    export VLLM_HPU_MULTI_MODEL_CONFIG=/path/to/multi_models.yaml
    ```

3. Launch the dedicated OpenAI-compatible entrypoint:

    ```bash
    python -m vllm_gaudi.entrypoints.openai.multi_model_api_server --port 8080
    ```

    See full online walkthrough in [Single-Process Model Swap (Online Quickstart)](../getting_started/quickstart/quickstart_single_process_model_swap_online.md).

4. Verify the configured model aliases:

    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:8080/v1/models | jq
    ```

5. Switch the active model in-process:

    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:8080/v1/models/switch \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "model": "qwen",
        "drain_timeout": 60
      }' | jq
    ```

**Notes:**

- `/v1/models` shows all configured aliases from the YAML file.
- Inference requests are served by the currently active model only.
- `/v1/models/switch` is intentionally gated behind `VLLM_SERVER_DEV_MODE=1`.
- `VLLM_ALLOW_INSECURE_SERIALIZATION=1` is required because the current in-process reconfigure path uses `cloudpickle` for internal config transfer. Enable this only for trusted/internal deployments.

## Planned Features

Future plugin releases are planned to provide support for the following vLLM features:

- Sliding window attention
- P/D disaggregate support
- In-place weight update
- Multinode support
- Pipeline parallel inference
